Hi, I'm feeling stressed because of exams. What should I do?
Hi, exams are meant to be stressful, but don't work yourself too hard! Always remember to take regular breaks!
But, doing so makes me feel so unproductive. I would rather be studying than resting! The test is hyper important, after all!
Don't worry! Taking breaks actually helps you to be more productive during your next study session.
Oh really? Thanks, I will try that out next time!
No problem.
